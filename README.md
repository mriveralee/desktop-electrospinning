# Research Code for Desktop Electrospinning

This is the research repository for `Desktop Electrospinning: A Single Extruder 3D Printer for Producing Rigid Plastic and Electrospun Textiles`. It contains the 3D printer firmware and control electronics set-up for the printer characterized in the publication  that can perform rigid plastic FDM 3D printer as well as melt electrospinning. [More information about the work can be found here](https://mikeriv.com/research/desktop-electrospinning/).

## 3D Printer Firmware and Control Electronics Set-up
This 3D printer uses a modified version of the Repeiter Firmware (v0.92) that includes add-ons for controlling high voltage via an infared signal. It also include firmware for two slave Arduino Nanos. One receives a high/low voltage signal from the 3D printer and sends out a corresponding an IR signal; the other Nano receives the IR signal and triggers a mechanical servo to open/close a connection to the high voltage ground on the 3D printer's build plate as well as toggle a solid-state relay that is connected to the high voltage power supply's AC-to-DC power adapter as shown in the simplified diagram below:
